### Hello, World! 👋🏼

My name's **Enrico**, and I'm a young **data scientist** from Italy! 🇮🇹  
I'm currently studying at [🎓 University of Udine](https://www.uniud.it/en/uniud-international?set_language=en).

I don't like social networks so much, so you can only find me on [👔 LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/enricostefanel/).  
You can also send me an [📧 e-mail](mailto:me@enst.it?subject=[GitHub]%20Greetings), if you want.

> There are two types of people in this world: those who see things happen, and those who make things happen.

See ya!
