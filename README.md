### Hello, World! 👋🏼

My name is Enrico, and I am a young Data Scientist from Italy (for a little less than half I am Canadian too, to be honest!).

I am currently attending the Master's Degree Course in *Data Science and Scientific Computing* at [University of Trieste](https://www.units.it/en), where I am following the *Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning* curriculum.

I am also working as Product Owner in the metals industry at [Danieli Automation S.p.A.](https://www.dca.it). In particular, I am working on the development of an Energy Management System (EMS).

I don't like social networks so much, so if you want to reach me you can connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/enricostefanel/) or you can send me an [e-mail](mailto:me@enst.it?subject=[GitHub]%20Greetings).

My favorite quote is:

> There are two types of people in this world: those who see things happen, and those who make things happen.

See you around!
