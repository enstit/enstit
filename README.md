### Hello, World! 👋🏼

My name's Enrico, and I'm a young Data Scientist from Italy (for a little less than half I'm Canadian too, to be honest!).

I'm currently attending the Master's Degree Course in *Data Science and Scientific Computing* at [University of Trieste](https://www.units.it/en), where I'm following the *Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning* curriculum.

I'm also working as Data Engineer in the metals industry at [SMS group S.p.A.](https://www.sms-group.com). In particular, I'm working on process control data.

I don't like social networks so much, so if you want to reach me you can connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/enricostefanel/), or you can send me an [e-mail](mailto:me@enst.it?subject=[GitHub]%20Greetings).

My favourite quote is:
> There are two types of people in this world: those who see things happen, and those who make things happen.

See ya!
